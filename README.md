Initialize the Environment (file->Scikit.py): Set up necessary Python libraries such as Scikit-learn to handle the data processing and machine learning functionalities.
Build the Classifier (file->Part 1.py): Train a machine learning model using a dataset labeled as 'spam' or 'ham' to enable the model to differentiate between spam and legitimate messages.
Validate the Model (file->Part 2.py): Test the trained model with a separate dataset to evaluate its accuracy in classifying messages, achieving a high accuracy rate of 98.8%.
Deploy the Application (file->prog.py): Utilize Flask to create a web application that allows users to input messages through a URL. The model processes these inputs to display results on whether messages are spam or ham.
